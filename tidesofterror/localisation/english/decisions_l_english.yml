 ENG_fenian_decisioncat: "Malcontents of Eire"
 ENG_fenian_decisioncat_desc: "The Fenian Council were of three irish upper-classmen; and this notion of Irish Independency began two years prior to its creation. Since then the council were gaining traction and causing instability throughout England and Scotland, but public approval suddenly turned when they detonated a bomb at Clerkenwell Prison in London, to attempt to free one of the Manchester Martyrs kept there.\n\nThis 'Irish Gunpowder Plot' practically blew up in their faces when the police immediately put down the perpertrators, letting no prisoners escape. This idea of an irish republic began with a most unruly riot in Kerry, Southern Ireland. It should've ended after the failure of a bombing, yet resentment in the southern region remains.\n\nWe shan't position troops within these areas, as any military presence would absolutely begin the chaos. Although, we can use this fact to the advantage of surprise.."
