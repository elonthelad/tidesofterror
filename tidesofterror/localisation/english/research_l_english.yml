These are very useful to have at hand, as some tasks will have any old soldier up and leave at the mention of."

The basin is lined with a gelatin, and the recipe is of dubious origin; but it is largely consituted of mercury, which lingers and sticks to the cranium, leaving an even grey-gel coat all over. This supposedly reflects the psychal influence of the eldritch menace, and frankly, it looks as ridiculous as it is effective. Some troops have taken to leaving their helmets and hats behind, all the while shaving bald as to tout the effectiveness of this bizzare technique."
 suptech_psychosomatic_company3: "Fear Exposure Therapy"
 suptech_psychosomatic_company3_desc: "In the training of a soldier, we take some of them through a montage of photographs and a medley of sound recordings.
