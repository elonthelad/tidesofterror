 basic_secondary_battery: "Casemate Secondary Battery"
 basic_secondary_battery_desc: "Placed in openings along the hull, these smaller guns give the ship some defense against smaller ships, but have a limited field of fire.\n\nMounting a §YSecondary Battery§! Module gives a §YCruiser§!, §YCarrier§!, or §YHeavy Ship§! a small amount of §YLight Gun Attack§! and allows it to engage a second target."
 improved_secondary_battery: "Turreted Secondary Battery"
 improved_secondary_battery_desc: "By placing the secondary guns in powered turrets, they gain a much wider field of fire at the expense of heavier weight and reduced stability in heavy seas.\n\nMounting a §YSecondary Battery§! Module gives a §YCruiser§!, §YCarrier§!, or §YHeavy Ship§! a small amount of §YLight Gun Attack§! and allows it to engage a second target."
 damage_control_1: "Fire Fighting Drills"
 damage_control_1_desc: "Every member of a ship's crew, from the Captain down to the simple sailor, must be able to help in containing and fighting fires onboard the ship."
 damage_control_2: "Separate Fire Mains"
 damage_control_2_desc: "By separating the main water lines around the ship, the probability of a hit rendering the ship completely unable to fight fires is much reduced."
 damage_control_3: "Diesel-powered Emergency Pumps"
 damage_control_3_desc: "With heavy pumps usually dependent on the main engines for power, a single and fairly light hit in the engine room may render the ship unable to stay afloat."
 fire_control_methods_1: "Bracket Shooting"
 fire_control_methods_1_desc: "To hit the target, the first step is to straddle it by firing a few guns at a time until the impacts hit on both sides of the target."
 fire_control_methods_2: "Ladder Shooting"
 fire_control_methods_2_desc: "Instead of firing over the target and losing track of the impacts behind the enemy ship, shots are deliberately dropped short of the target and the distance between impact and target measured to determine the range."
 fire_control_methods_3: "Shell Dyes"
 fire_control_methods_3_desc: "Adding small color packages to the shells when they are fired colors the impacts around the target and allows multiple ships to engage the same target without being confused by each other's impacts."
 fuel_silos: "Fuel Storage"
 fuel_silos_desc: "Mass Storage of fuel requires a complex set of tanks, pipes, and valves to ensure it is both secure and readily available."
 fuel_refining: "Fuel Refining I"
