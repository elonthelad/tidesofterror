 ### EQUIPMENT MODULES ###
 amphibious_drive: "Amphibious Drive"
 amphibious_drive_desc: "A set of floatation devices and a small screw allow this tank to quickly be rigged to traverse water, either from ship to shore or across a river."
 sloped_armor: "Sloped Armor"
 sloped_armor_desc: "Armor placed at an angle to an incoming shell has a much greater effective thickness than the same amount of armor placed vertically. It also increases the chance that the shell will simply bounce off harmlessly. However, it requires the entire tank to be designed around it, making the vehicle more difficult to assemble."
 stabilizer: "Stabilizer"
 stabilizer_desc: "A mechanical device to keep the gun pointing in the same direction when the tank is moving. While not advanced enough to allow accurate firing on the move, it does allow the gunner to fire accurately during a short stop, without having to re-acquire the target."
 smoke_launchers: "Smoke Launchers"
 smoke_launchers_desc: "A battery of pyrotechnic devices that can be triggered from inside the tank to create a thick cloud of smoke to hide the tank. Very useful when on the defensive or after driving into an ambush."
 extra_ammo_storage: "Extra Ammunition Storage"
 extra_ammo_storage_desc: "Additional racks of ready ammunition allow the tank to stay in the fight much longer without resupply. However, if the armor is penetrated, the results are likely to be catastrophic. This is particularly problematic when attacking."
 wet_ammo_storage: "Wet Ammunition Storage"
 wet_ammo_storage_desc: "Water jackets added to ammunition racks dramatically reduce the risk of the ammunition exploding after the tank is hit, which is greatly appreciated by the crews."
 DESIGNER_CHASSIS_BASE: "Chassis: "
 DESIGNER_FROM_MODULES: "Modules: "
 DESIGNER_UNSAVED_CHANGES: "Unsaved changes: "
 tank_rocket_launcher: "Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc: "A multi-barrelled launcher for unguided, high-explosive rockets. The high volume of fire gives it excellent performance against soft targets, but even direct hits do little against armored targets."
 tank_rocket_launcher_2: "Improved Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_2_desc: "While there are a number of improvements to accuracy, the main advantage of this improved rocket launcher is that it can hold more rockets to fire at the enemy."
 tank_wheeled_suspension: "Wheeled Suspension"
 tank_wheeled_suspension_desc: "Derived from a truck chassis, this suspension is very limited in its carrying capacity and has limited cross-country performance, but has the advantage of being very cheap to make."
 tank_half_track_suspension: "Half-track Suspension"
 tank_half_track_suspension_desc: "A hybrid between a fully-tracked vehicle and a regular wheeled suspension, this setup has a pair of wheels up front for steering and a tracked rear axle to improve cross-country performance. While limited in its carrying capacity, it is still cheaper than a fully-tracked design."
 squeezebore_adaptor: "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc: "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."
 armor_skirts: "Armor Skirts"
 armor_skirts_desc: "A set of thin metal plates mounted on the side of the vehicle, giving additional protection against anti-tank rifles and shaped charges."
 dozer_blade: "Dozer Blade"
 dozer_blade_desc: "A dozer blade allows the vehicle to quickly build a fighting position in the field without the support of engineers."
 auto_loader: "Auto Loader"
 auto_loader_desc: "An auomatic mechanism that loads shells and allows the tank to keep a high rate of fire for a prolonged period of time."
 easy_maintenance: "Easy Maintenance"
 easy_maintenance_desc: "Hatches around the vehicle give access to many different components of the vehicle, and allow the crew to perform even complex maintenance fairly easily."
 additional_machine_guns: "Additional Machineguns"
 additional_machine_guns_desc: "A set of machineguns in sponsons and special pintle mounts give the vehicle improved defense against close-in infantry attack."
 
 expanded_fuel_tank: "Fuel Drum"
 expanded_fuel_tank_desc: "An externally mounted fuel drum designed to extend the operational range of an armored vehicle."

 hardsuit_ceramic: "Ceramic"
 hardsuit_ceramic_desc: "While not as durable as steel, ceramics provide adequate armor in the face of regular ballistics and close-quarters engagements. It is also notable that the melting point and insulation of the material is notably high, protecting against shocking attacks, shockingly well. Additionally, ceramics are easier to procure and work than metals. They are also quite lightweight."
 hardsuit_steel: "Steel"
 hardsuit_steel_desc: "As strong as it is prominent, when can't you rely on steel? Bullets fly off it, and it'll shrug shrapnel and explosives off like it always will. Bear in mind, this strength is warranted by its cumbersome heft."
 hardsuit_mnalloysteel: "Hadfield Steel"
 hardsuit_mnalloysteel_desc: "This alloy sees to it that Manganese is introduced to the Steel compound. This brings some desired qualities, such as higher toughness, hardier reaction to impacts and abrasions, and most importantly- An outstanding insulating ability.\n\nLuddite metalworkers look down on the meddling of cold hard steel, but they have yet to witness the shocking bolts of the eldritch menace, haven't they?"
 hardsuit_ceramometal: "Ceramometals"
 hardsuit_ceramometal_desc: "A new combination found in military innovation, this fine hybrid spares no great weaknesses or compromises; it is the very definition of balance. It is well insulated, sufficiently protective, while being lighter and cheaper than pure metal solutions."
 hardsuit_reinforcedoak: "Reinforced Oak"
 hardsuit_reinforcedoak_desc: "Some would look at a Hardsuit bearing wooden armour, and scoff. Then, you'll show them the outstanding production charts, see how they laugh then!"

 hardsuit_groundingrods: "Grounding Rods"
 hardsuit_groundingrods_desc: "These negatively charged poles do a first-rate job of attracting and dissipating electric charge in the immediate vicinity. The object of these modifications is to divert shocks from the battlefield to a controlled area, allowing other units to advance safely. That is, relative safety."
 hardsuit_thermalinsulation: "Thermal Insulation"
 hardsuit_thermalinsulation_desc: "Accidents and raging infernos are a common occurence in the modern battlefield. Using an innovative substance known as asbestos, we can temper these flames on this machine greatly, which can be especially prudent when using volatile hydraulics.\n\nThankfully, asbestos is known to have no adverse, long-lasting or toxic affects to the operator of the machine!"
 hardsuit_liftingapparatus: "Lifting Apparatus"
 hardsuit_liftingapparatus_desc: "When it comes to barricading and rapid defense, few solutions compares to re-using the objects and debris of the local area and town. This requites a great deal of lifting and transport, and using the great brawn found in these machines we can assist in this desperate defense."
 hardsuit_riotermodification: "Bluecoat Retrofit"
 hardsuit_riotermodification_desc: "While not being suited for combat with demons on the battlefield, this model will help us quell the demons at home. Seeing as our streets grow with feverish unrest and violence, it looks as if more extreme measures are going to see the most effective use. One of these measures comes in the form of an imposing metalman powered by pistons."
 hardsuit_immersionbowl: "Immersion Bowl"
 hardsuit_immersionbowl_desc: "This cap is worn on the interior of the helmet, sheltering the cranium area of the operator. The 'Bowl' is a jelly of quicksilver and some unidentified substance. This invention was conceived from a sect of explorers that had ventured deep into the heart of darkness, of which are among the few that had returned with their wits about them. As ridiculous as it looks and seems, they swear by the application of this gel in military use and implore us to deploy it widely, as they affirm that it regulates the humours and dulls the psychal impact found when facing against the eldritch menace."
 hardsuit_dryplatecamera: "Dry Plate Camera"
 hardsuit_dryplatecamera_desc: "There is room on the armour where we may insert a full-size camera into, allowing armoured soldiers to enter previously perilous combat or occupied zones. This imaging can be invaluable to reconnaitre and intelligence."
 hardsuit_localdischargefield: "Local Discharge Field"
 hardsuit_localdischargefield_desc: "A Local Discharge Field is certainly an experimental technology, as it uses an array of Grove cells to rapidly jolt the surface of the armour at the soldiers command. This shock does not at all damage the operator, but assuredly will dazzle and fry any creature or thing that may be trying to forcefully open or get inside the suit."
