 amphibious_tank_chassis: "Amphibious Tank Chassis"
 amphibious_tank_chassis_desc: "A small tank hull specifically designed to float. To achieve this, strict limits have to be set on the size of the weapon and the thickness of the armor the vehicle carries."
 amphibious_tank_chassis_1: "Amphibious Tank Chassis"
 gwtank_chassis: "Inter-War Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc: "The tank has proven itself a powerful weapon in the Great War. While development has slowed in the intervening years, it is no doubt going to play a major role in the wars to come."
 armor_tech_1: "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc: "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2: "Improved Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_2_desc: "With heavier and heavier anti-tank weapons being fielded around the world, the next generation of tanks will require even better protection."
 armor_tech_3: "Advanced Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_3_desc: "While the limit of deployed anti-tank guns has likely been reached, a new generation of tanks will carry more advanced weaponry, which is able to pierce any current level of protection at long range."
 armor_tech_4: "Modern Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc: "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 engine_tech_1: "Basic Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc: "Where the tanks of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."
 engine_tech_2: "Improved Engine"
 engine_tech_2_desc: "With bigger guns and heavier armor, the new generation of tanks requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3: "Advanced Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc: "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 engine_tech_4: "Modern Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc: "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."

 tank_rocket_launcher: "Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc: "A multi-barrelled launcher for unguided, high-explosive rockets. The high volume of fire gives it excellent performance against soft targets, but even direct hits do little against armored targets."
 tank_rocket_launcher_2: "Improved Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_2_desc: "While there are a number of improvements to accuracy, the main advantage of this improved rocket launcher is that it can hold more rockets to fire at the enemy."
 tank_wheeled_suspension: "Wheeled Suspension"
 tank_wheeled_suspension_desc: "Derived from a truck chassis, this suspension is very limited in its carrying capacity and has limited cross-country performance, but has the advantage of being very cheap to make."
 tank_half_track_suspension: "Half-track Suspension"
 tank_half_track_suspension_desc: "A hybrid between a fully-tracked vehicle and a regular wheeled suspension, this setup has a pair of wheels up front for steering and a tracked rear axle to improve cross-country performance. While limited in its carrying capacity, it is still cheaper than a fully-tracked design."
 squeezebore_adaptor: "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc: "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."
 armor_skirts: "Armor Skirts"
 armor_skirts_desc: "A set of thin metal plates mounted on the side of the vehicle, giving additional protection against anti-tank rifles and shaped charges."
 dozer_blade: "Dozer Blade"
 dozer_blade_desc: "A dozer blade allows the vehicle to quickly build a fighting position in the field without the support of engineers."

 hardsuit_ceramic: "Ceramic"
 hardsuit_ceramic_desc: "While not as durable as steel, ceramics provide adequate armor in the face of regular ballistics and close-quarters engagements. It is also notable that the melting point and insulation of the material is notably high, protecting against shocking attacks, shockingly well. Additionally, ceramics are easier to procure and work than metals. They are also quite lightweight."
 hardsuit_steel: "Steel"
 hardsuit_steel_desc: "As strong as it is prominent, when can't you rely on steel? Bullets fly off it, and it'll shrug shrapnel and explosives off like it always will. Bear in mind, this strength is warranted by its cumbersome heft."

This brings some desired qualities, such as higher toughness, hardier reaction to impacts and abrasions, and most importantly- An outstanding insulating ability.\n\nLuddite metalworkers look down on the meddling of cold hard steel, but they have yet to witness the shocking bolts of the eldritch menace, haven't they?"

The object of these modifications is to divert shocks from the battlefield to a controlled area, allowing other units to advance safely. That is, relative safety."
 hardsuit_thermalinsulation: "Thermal Insulation"
 hardsuit_thermalinsulation_desc: "Accidents and raging infernos are a common occurence in the modern battlefield. Using an innovative substance known as asbestos, we can temper these flames on this machine greatly, which can be especially prudent when using volatile hydraulics.\n\nThankfully, asbestos is known to have no adverse, long-lasting or toxic affects to the operator of the machine!"
 hardsuit_liftingapparatus: "Lifting Apparatus"
 hardsuit_liftingapparatus_desc: "When it comes to barricading and rapid defense, few solutions compares to re-using the objects and debris of the local area and town. This requites a great deal of lifting and transport, and using the great brawn found in these machines we can assist in this desperate defense."
 hardsuit_riotermodification: "Bluecoat Retrofit"
 hardsuit_riotermodification_desc: "While not being suited for combat with demons on the battlefield, this model will help us quell the demons at home. Seeing as our streets grow with feverish unrest and violence, it looks as if more extreme measures are going to see the most effective use. One of these measures comes in the form of an imposing metalman powered by pistons."
 hardsuit_immersionbowl: "Immersion Bowl"
 hardsuit_immersionbowl_desc: "This cap is worn on the interior of the helmet, sheltering the cranium area of the operator. The 'Bowl' is a jelly of quicksilver and some unidentified substance. This invention was conceived from a sect of explorers that had ventured deep into the heart of darkness, of which are among the few that had returned with their wits about them. As ridiculous as it looks and seems, they swear by the application of this gel in military use and implore us to deploy it widely, as they affirm that it regulates the humours and dulls the psychal impact found when facing against the eldritch menace."
 hardsuit_dryplatecamera: "Dry Plate Camera"
 hardsuit_dryplatecamera_desc: "There is room on the armour where we may insert a full-size camera into, allowing armoured soldiers to enter previously perilous combat or occupied zones. This imaging can be invaluable to reconnaitre and intelligence."
 hardsuit_localdischargefield: "Local Discharge Field"
 hardsuit_localdischargefield_desc: "A Local Discharge Field is certainly an experimental technology, as it uses an array of Grove cells to rapidly jolt the surface of the armour at the soldiers command. This shock does not at all damage the operator, but assuredly will dazzle and fry any creature or thing that may be trying to forcefully open or get inside the suit."
