 roziere_balloon: "Roziere Balloon"
 roziere_balloon_desc: "§LThis balloon is a seperate chamber above the main gasbag, using a non-heated gas and gives greater control of buoyancy and steering. This can even allow the construct to allow crews to travel days, or even weeks with the right supplies, althought the larger size can make it an even bigger target in combat.§!"
 retractable_sail: "Retractable Sails"
 retractable_sail_desc: "§LRetractable Sails allow for controllable additional speed and levy a small amount of steering to the vessel. The retractable nature of this feature allows for a small profile when needed, as not to compromise the safety of the aircraft in dire situations.§!"

 steerable_sail: "Steerable Sails"
 steerable_sail_desc: "§LSteerable Sails do not retract but have pulleys to aim their direction, giving incredible control over the winds and direction of flight. They are however, always open, and bring a significant weakness and point of failure to the machine.§!"

 manganese_infused_steel_panel_desc: "§LRegular thick steel panels intertwined with the bizzare chemistry of Manganese. Highly resistant to electricity and boasts higher tensile strength.§!"
 steel_panel: "Steel Panel"
 steel_panel_desc: "§LUsing steel panels can be particularly strong on the defence, if inordinately heavy for such a delicate flying vehicle.§!"
 aluminium_panel: "Aluminium Panel"
 aluminium_panel_desc: "§LAluminium panels bring the protective properties of metals, while easing the weight load on the vehicle greatly. It's harder to procure this material, and currently harder to work, but the savings on weight can make space for more auxillary components.§!"
 canvas: "Canvas"
 canvas_desc: "§LKnown to be slightly better than a placebo; inexpensive canvas largely exists on the aircraft to assist in wind resistance and lift, and considering protection, it still largely concerns just the wind. Any regular ballistic attack will rip right through as if it wasn't there to begin with.§!"
 wooden_panels: "Wooden Panels"
 wooden_panels_desc: "§LRegular wooden panels bolster the otherwise naked frame, added a fair bit of defence while not encumbering the aircraft all too much. Notably easy to work, too.§!"

 high_quality_desc: "§LImmaculate attention to detail has been taken to ensure all parts are functional, every bolt, tie, wing and joint has been double and triple tested. It will take much longer to deploy off the production line, but it is every second worth it, after all, the quality of our equipment will be seen on the broad field of the battle, and if you go in with sub-par machinery, what do you get? A sub-par result!§!"
 factory_finish: "Factory Finish"
 factory_finish_desc: "§LRegular checks are put in place as with any equipment. This is obviously a tried and true method, we've spent years perfecting it so why change now?§!"
 smaller_build: "Smaller Build"
 smaller_build_desc: "§LWe are crimping on parts you'd never notice were gone. A bolt, a joint here and there, what's the difference? All spared resources are resources that are put into more individual machines, and the more individual machines we have deployed, the fiercer we'll be.§!"
 hasty_construction: "Hasty Construction"
 hasty_construction_desc: "§LDemand dictates that we need to output this product as fast as can be. Almost no checks are done on the machine. Parts go missing. A weapon may misfire, the chassis may creak, but whats the difference when your squad is bringing dozens of the things? Scavenging and repairs-on-the-fly are all to be expected when operating these new prototypes anyhow.§!"
