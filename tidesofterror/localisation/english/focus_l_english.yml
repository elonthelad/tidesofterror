 #ENG Focuses
 
 ENG_the_freight_crisis: "The Freight Crisis"
 ENG_the_freight_crisis_desc: "The Freight Crisis has wracked our internal economy relentlessly- since we returned from our last campaign across the southeastern charter in Burma, absolutely none of our clippers or steamers have returned to port at all. Our inventories remain starved; supply lines in disrepair, our harbours clamouring for help, not to mention the common populace that suspect even a plot of epic proportion. We must have find a conclusion, or perhaps a nicely framed scapegoat."
 
 ENG_the_expedition: "The Expedition"
 ENG_the_expedition_desc: "Options have run dry. All classes and sectors of society are finding scapegoats in everything, yet no clear answer shows itself. We must dive into the heart of darkness, the sea which chokes with fog. A plan has been devised for the Right Honourable's acquainted academy captain, the young Lord Marion Boyd to lead in a routine expedition to Calais, hailing from Dover. It's but a mere two-hour trip there, but the all-encompassing fog may show its hand.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?"
 
 ENG_dredge_the_vessel: "Dredge the Vessel"
 ENG_dredge_the_vessel_desc: "The debris of the HMS Undaunted lies in a shallow, grim cove of the Channel. Even our admiralty have reputed the ruins as curs'd, and plead us to leave it be. But there are sure to be records and vestiges that will show us what happened to the boat, we must preserve this to discover more about the endless fog."
 
 ENG_beware_the_seas: "Beware the Seas"
 ENG_beware_the_seas_desc: "The vessel disturbs all in its vicinity. It invades the minds of men and grants us troubled thoughts. What happened to the ship? Why does it curse our minds? The only answer could come from the good book, and it tells us this is the work of the puppeteer, the Devil."
 
 ENG_phantasmic_molluscs: "Phantasm Molluscs..?"
 ENG_phantasmic_molluscs_desc: "With what remains of the Undaunted in safe hands at port in Brighton, it has been examined closely and, truthfully, dozens of peculiar sea-creatures have oozed out of the mire of the broken and rotten hull. They closest resemble Clionidae, or 'Sea-angels' yet they exude some kind of mystical and otherworldly presence.. Ultimately, they must have some connection with the encounter during the failed expedition, and in turn, the ailing captain. We wonder ever-more what they may be hiding."
 
 ENG_alleviate_the_madman: "The Curse-Touched Survivor"
 ENG_alleviate_the_madman_desc: "The vessel has landed ashore a wreck. No survivors remain, not a bone, except the delegate himself. Unfortunately, the man is in absolute hysterics and the site has been closed to the anxious, prying eyes of the public. What used to be a perfectly agreeable captain is naught but a chattering, howling lunatic; though we have our methods to mend his traumas, the worrying part is considering what force could have possibly imposed itself to ravage the ship and its crew entirely, yet bring it home with naught but one survivor?"
 
 ENG_furtive_guidance: "Furtive Guidance"
 ENG_furtive_guidance_desc: "Ah, the gift of the greater knowledge. Provingly, it is enough to turn a man mad. But he was a mere pawn in our workings, and it'd be naught but irresponsible of us to leave him alone, stewing away with this insight. Let us commune, and uncover these wyrd mysteries. \n\nAfter all, what's the harm in a little private audience of our own?"
 
 ENG_invasive_extraction: "Invasive Excision"
 ENG_invasive_extraction_desc: "The young man that was once an aspiring captain now chitters and howls in the despair of his broken psyche. It has reached a point, that even these silent screams deliver our interrogators a disturbing fright; and needless to mention, these men had thought they'd seen it all. They declare their refusal of regular work until something be done about it. This lunatic is a special case indeed, and mayhaps the only way to return this wracked mind to normality, would be at the hand of experimental means..."
 
 ENG_lockdown_the_harbour: "Lockdown the Harbour"
 ENG_lockdown_the_harbour_desc: "Our workers report it is nigh-on impossible to cooperate with the locals. We have to divert resources to reconcile the town and local parish to allow our operatives to continue."
 
 ENG_address_the_public: "Address the Public"
 
 
 ENG_stop_independent_reporters_desc: "Even the local papers of the southern area have spread the word about our investigation- They claim to discredit our integrity, but we're better than that, and we have the assets to make it happen, whether they like it or not."
 ENG_bribe_independent_reporters_desc: "Money oils the wheels of journalism, and we are not one to miss out on an opportunity like so. The press must be kept silent, lest the people lose faith in us, and just a spare coin here and there, will cover our tracks."
