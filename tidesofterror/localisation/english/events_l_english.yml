 british.1.t: "The Freight Crisis"
 british.1.d: "The popularly coined 'Freight Crisis' is nothing more than the all-encompassing deep fog settling in off the far shores, as the many trade fleets of the empire succumbed to the unknowable terrors that lie in waiting. Factories and their churning machines fall to a sudden stop when the steady stream of supply from sovereign nations and colonies halts. This is to say nothing of the countless families that have seperated as visitors, foreigners and travellers alike remain stranded, unable to return home to their country and kin.\n\nThe government convenes, now, to decide what to allocate their time towards. In time these three stratagems will see their due, but only one can maintain the primary focus of the nation. Now, they decide."
 british.1.a: "We shall focus on §YRe-Housing Expatriates.§!"
 british.1.b: "We shall focus on §YHalting Sea Routes.§!"
 british.1.c: "We shall focus on §YRepaying the Industry Magnates.§!"
 british.1.e: "Perhaps we should §Ydivide our focus§! on all aspects..?"
 
 british.2.t: "SUPPLY LINES IN DISTRESS"
 british.2.d: "The crisis in the Empire's freight supply has become more acute than ever, the Lord Chamberlain announcing that his department is now "unable to issue any further licenses." The situation threatens to degenerate, he declares ominously, into a state of chaos. "We can no longer guarantee that every Londoner shall be supplied with coal for the remainder of the winter," he added. Convoys and clippers hailing from our colonies and alliances have gone mysteriously quiet during our afterglow from the campaign in the Burma proper. Unprecedented and ungainly fog seeps down from all coasts, muddling all communications across the Channel and beyond. And the extent and severity of this new form of inclement weather are calculated by many to portend some approaching change of climate.\n\nTrade bosses exclaim the disrepair their factories have been laden unto, and in discussion they had all but disregarded any excuses, and insist on immediate reparation. They say the time has come at last when "we must face facts". Production has reached an all-time low for the ages."
 british.2.a: "The Industrialists will just have to be patient, as much as the rest of us."
 
 british.3.t: "The Expedition Commences"
 british.3.d: "[GetDateText], marks the first of many excursions into the impregnable fog, which soon would be known to the masses as the first of many mistakes yet to come. The men of the dock and the trusted delegate with his entourage await, standing at the slipway, unbeknownst to them, the creatures that lurk in the ocean, mere metres ahead of them. "I have sailed the seas of Britain for decades sire," Explained the Captain, steadily. "And I have never seen the like. It is as if the waters themselves are covered in a thick, rancid oil, and the air is suffocating, its like the stench of dead old seafood." "Captain. There's absolutely nothing to worry about- It's just weather from the north sea stirring the current, and besides; this whole charade is preposterous.." The young admiral muttered, slowly considering the possibility of anything other than simple sea-winds acting up. "I really ought to be back at the academy as of now, but i'm indebted to the prime minister and he's cashing in his favour." He continued to complain.\n\nThe HMS Undaunted, a sturdy yet old vessel, was towed into port with its masts retracted, appearing from the fog piece by piece. Two guide boats laid to its side pulling it to, and thus the crew boarded the ship."
 british.3.a: "What happened to them?"
 british.3.b: "I do wonder what lies out there.."
 british.3.c: "Just tell me when they return and we'll wait for all this to blow over."
 
 british.4.t: "The Transient Deep"
 british.4.d: "Dark and vapid is the expanse, and ever calm it remains. As the journey continues, the sailors and deckhands slowly realise that they no longer recognise this world that they inhabit. The fog blocks all sight, enveloping and taking whatever enters its domain. And for these intruders, their time is out. "Cap'n!" A nervous deckboy rushed to the helm, panting; "There be- uh, eels..?" The captain, turned sharply towards him. "Eels? What on earth are ye on about, lad?" He barked. "I saw 'em- Eels, sir. In the water. Coming right for us from the bottom. They're huge too, bigger'n the-" And the boat abruptly rocked with a thunderous crash, sending the crew and the delegate reeling backwards, to land hard on the floor. The deep swelled, and the bizarre creatures thrashed, collapsing around the Undaunted. But then, in the midst of the chaos- the delegate felt the universe for a moment and called out to him. Echoes, in his mind, in a language he couldn't bear; yet he understood fully. Eyes closed, he stood motionless, as the ship around him buckled and crashed as the slender things slammed and tore apart the vessel. The crew took weapons, trying as hard as they could to fend off the huge, lurching ligaments, though their efforts were futile. And in an instant, the admiral opened his eyes and was transported to a plane beyond words."
 british.4.a: "Don't tell me anymore. I've heard enough."
 british.4.b: "How exciting!"
 
 british.5.t: "Graced by God"
 british.5.d: "\nWhat did he see, standing so serenely on the endless plateau of the arcane sea? It was He. The one from above, descended to our remote planet to bestow us with its otherworldly knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhispers in his ear. Prophetic murmurs deep in his psyche. Embedding its abyssal truth deep down into the humbled, insignificant man, waking him from his dreams of ignorance, tearing his mind apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did he hear, looking on at the visage of God?\nPerhaps we're better off not knowing."
 british.5.a: "These secrets lie between him and the gods now."
 british.5.b: "I will uncover the eldritch truth, any way I must."
 
 british.6.t: "SHIPWRECK AT DOVER"
 british.6.d: ""
 british.6.a: "I really had hoped against this."
 
 test.1.t: "Concessions to the Covenant"
 test.1.d: "Dear Commander-in-Chief,\n\nI write to you with grave concerns regarding a recent development in the north. The malcontents who name themselves 'Covenant' has officially staked a claim on York and are demanding the city of Scarborough and imports from the Crown. While I understand the need for diplomacy and peaceful coexistence as they have proven to be extremely violent when provoked, yet I fear that conceding to their demands may set a dangerous precedent for other groups seeking to establish their own territories within our very borders.\n\nI trust that you will make the right decision in this matter, and I look forward to your accord on this issue.\n\nSincerely, General Hall, Conrad"
 test.1.a: "No more violence- They can have the city!"
 test.1.b: "That ungodly flock will turn. Siege them out."
 test.1.c: "Send to them nothing. Assemble the Cavalry."
 
 test.2.t: "HORROR FROM BELOW"
 test.2.d: "Yesterday, another tragic incident occurred off the coast of Dover as a horrific leviathan cephalopod attacked and destroyed a large ship. Eyewitnesses reported that the creature emerged from the depths of the sea with a ferocity that shook even the bravest of sailors. Its tentacles, each as thick as a great oak, wrapped themselves around the vessel and tore it apart with ease, sending it to the bottom of the ocean in a matter of a few shocking moments.\n\nThe crew of the ship, caught unawares by the sudden onslaught, fought valiantly to prevent the beast, but their efforts proved futile against its immense size and strength. Many brave sailors lost their lives in the struggle, and their families are left to mourn their tragic loss.\n\nWill these incidents continue, and do they tell of a perhaps ancient danger that lurks beneath the waves, and of a world that we may have never seen the likes of in our lives. The Admiralty has assured us that they are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our seafarers, and we can only hope that they will be successful in their efforts and better prepared for any additional attacks, god grant us mercy.\n\nWe mourn the loss of those who perished in this senseless attack, and our thoughts are with their loved ones during this difficult time. The government has issued a warning; Stay away from deep water, no matter how aluding it may be. It cannot be trusted."
 test.2.a: "And vigilant shall we be."
 
 test.3.t: "Source Of The Tremors"
 test.3.d: "After great delving, our brave expeditioneers have uncovered the entrance to one of what mayhaps be, many tombs. The lithic structure is gargantuan, reeks of the sea and slumbers in a great reservoir. Shall we press on?\n\nThe company is §G12§! Strong."
 test.3.a: "Can you tell me more?"
 test.3.b: "We aren't ready for this, return immediately."
 test.3.c: "Of course. Carry on, team."
 test.3.e: "I'll decide later."
  
 test.4.t: "A Sign from Beyond"
 test.4.d: "Seek the tomb which rests at the depths of the §CBay of Lundy§!.\n\nPerform an expedition there."
 test.4.a: "I understand what I must do."
