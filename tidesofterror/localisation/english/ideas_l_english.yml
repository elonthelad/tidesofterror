 ENGIDEA_fenian_remnants_desc: "The Fenian Republic was a proposed independent repubilic to own the four total regions of Ireland. The council of three were gaining traction and causing instability throughout England and Scotland, but public approval suddenely turned when they detonated a bomb at Clerkenwell Prison in London, to attempt to free one of the Manchester Martyrs kept there. This 'Irish Gunpowder Plot' practically blew up in their faces when the police immediately put down the perpertrators, letting no prisoners escape. This idea of an irish republic began with a most unruly riot in Kerry, Southern Ireland. It should've ended after the failure of a bombing, yet resentment in the southern region remains."
