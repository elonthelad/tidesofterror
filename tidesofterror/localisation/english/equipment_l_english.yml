The extreme recoil upon firing this infernal contrivance often inflicts greater harm upon the user than the intended adversary. Only the stoutest and valiant of men can bear the use of such a weapon, but when the enemy lays eyes upon a colossal man toting this demonic machine, they usually flee before he can even prepare to discharge it."
 
 scorch_equipment: "Flammables"
