Encounters-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encounters are country_events that will appear every few days/weeks when progressing or leaving a site. Sometimes, they can be positive and require a skill check to unlock the buff/treasure, however most of the time, they will be negative and may not give you a choice in the result. In these options, the encounter might let the player spend a supply related to the nature of the encounter to improve the result.

Encounters have skill checks with increasing thresholds as the depth & room number increase, but the checks are set between a variable range before they are put against the players team total score in the respective skill.

Encounter Categories-

Volition
This governs all horrifying things. Terror, disgust, and most manners of strange eldritch happenings. Takes priority when an otherwise Conflict encounter contains an entity beyond reasoning.

Conflict
This covers all fights, be it against monsters, animals, other people or even infighting between the crew.

Appraisal
This covers most encounters to do with relics, books, ancient language and precious treasure.

Labouring
This governs all forms of mining, digging, clearing rubble and debris.

Danger-

Danger is a malus to all skills that is calculated when the company is designed, this mechanic exists to prevent players from spamming one meta weapon or supply while ignoring others they would've needed. It should be a calculation that considers how much food each crewmember would eat on the sites average time to complete, compares that against the amount of food brought, it would also compare the hidden stat 'depth' from sites against the amount of lights brought, and so on. This stops the player from suceeding with nonsense builds. The malus should be fairly subtle, but enough to turn the tide in many encounters. It should also lower the maximum morale, which makes sense context wise for the crew to be worried about a ridiculous build.

Supplies-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Food is used by everyone for every week that passes. Soldiers consume slightly more food. Occultists use slightly less food cuz they magic. When food runs out, everyone begins to starve and has an increasing chance to die every week, until they escape or somehow find some food again, where the chance resets to its base value.

In the planning phase, food is added/removed by steps of 10 at a time.
Per/10 Food-
+15 Weight
+10 Prod. Cost

Tools are used in certain events and are lost or broken easily. When tools run out, cave-ins become impossible walls, and some escape options may quickly vanish.

In the planning phase, tools are added/removed by steps of 2 at a time.
Per/2 Tools-
+10 Weight
+20 Prod. Cost

Lights are vital the lower the crew is. Near the surface, lights are consumed very slowly, but at low depths lights get consumed at their full speed, increasing with every 2 crewmembers. When lights go out in the far depths, things become incredibly hard quick. Escape is unlikely in this scenario.

In the planning phase, lights are added/removed by steps of 6 at a time.
Per/6 lights-
+8 Weight
+15 Prod. Cost

Medical supplies are spent to mitigate deaths and injury, and occasionally and optionally, morale loss. When medical supplies run out, this no longer becomes possible, and deaths are likely, especially in Conflict encounters.

In the planning phase, medical supplies are added/removed by steps of 4 at a time.
Per/4 meds-
+10 Weight
+25 Prod. Cost

Alcohol can be spent when resting to boost morale. Dont bring too much, however, as an overabundance of alcohol will lead to just a terrible lads night out in a pit of eldritch horrors- never ends well.

In the planning phase, alcohol is added/removed by steps of 10 at a time.
Per/10 Alcohol-
+5 Weight
+15 Prod. Cost

All these stats for weapons and supplies are up for balancing, these are just initial

Map/Progression-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sites all have a preset time to finish. As progress continues through sites, a random number of country_events can happen, selected from a pool of events that each site picks from. They happen in no particular order, so they have to be a little generic. The first event is unique to each one, giving a short description of what lies ahead etc. The final event is also unique, where the reward is found. After either choosing to leave early or finishing the site fully, whats left of the crew will leave, taking half the time it took to get to where they reached last. 

At any moment during the journey, there is a button in the menu that can recall the team, if the site type allows it. They will attempt to leave the way they came, taking the same amount of time they took getting as far as they had. Some new dangerous encounters may happen during this making it a risk decision for the player whether to brunt the difficulty of leaving early, or continuing so they dont have to make multiple trips, saving time for the sake of risk.

The expedition crew has a morale stat, which is not shown to the player at all. When morale is below a threshold, some crewmembers may start deserting the team, and once it reaches 0, the team will suffer mania and the journey will be declared failed, or they may even outright commit suicide, which of course will also fail the mission. Failed missions can be revisited, but for each loss in a specific site, beginning morale on that area takes a hit. If missions are failed 3 times, they become unavailable no matter what.

Sites can only be begun and evacuated if the state is not under alien control. Sea tombs can only be begun and evacuated if the sea region has >50% supremacy. Sites will continue as normal even if they lose control, this is just for starting and leaving. If the team has returned to the surface, they will leave as soon as control is regained. New journeys cannot be started while waiting, so the player will either have to return control or abandon the site for good.
